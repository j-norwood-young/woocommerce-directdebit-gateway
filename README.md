This plugin allows WooCommerce to handle payments through Direct Debits.

## Description

This plugin allows WooCommerce to handle payments through Direct Debits. It is built by Daily Maverick and Jason Norwood-Young. Direct Debits are tricky because they are asynchronous, can take days to process, and can be reversed weeks later. We assume once an e-mandate is created that the payment is complete.
