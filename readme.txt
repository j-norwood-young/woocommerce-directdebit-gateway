This plugin allows WooCommerce to handle payments through Direct Debits.

== Description ==

This plugin allows WooCommerce to handle payments through Direct Debits. It is built by Daily Maverick. Direct Debits are tricky because they are asynchronous, can take days to process, and can be reversed weeks later. We assume once an e-mandate is created that the payment is complete.
